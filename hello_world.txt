I cannot believe I did not add anything to this file.
Anyway, I am adding text now.
Then I will do the git changes to update the GitHub.
Longer term, I would like to find out how to:
   - wrap text to 72 lines
   - enlarge the text in the tiny side panel

   Well - I do not understand - I saved the changes 
   to this file and followed the instructions to
   update git.

   And the file on my GitHub is still empty.
   Therefore I am adding more text. From line 8 
   onward, to try again.
